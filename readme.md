# Spotify api

This app was made to check how Spotify API works, and to face some new challenges.

## What you can do in it?

You can check all your playlists and songs in it, also there are direct links to check every single track. There are your top songs and with links. Also, I have implemented the feature that I miss in Spotify, you can check your recently listened tracks, with links and 30sec of track preview.  

Website is fully responsive with mobile view. 

## What have i used?

Beside React, I used node.js server to make spotify authentication and obtain the authentication token. I have pushed server to Heroku, and app is hosted on Netlify so everything is working correctly. 

Feel free to use it whenever you want :)
